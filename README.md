# Bank Credit Approval
The project involves several key activities. First, the dataset for credit approval is loaded, and a visual inspection is conducted to understand the distribution of credit approval based on each attribute, identifying variables crucial for data separation. Next, the dataset is prepared, and missing values are imputed using the missForest library. The dataset is then divided into training and test sets. Subsequently, Ridge and Lasso regularized logistic regression models are trained on the training set, with the goal of selecting the model with the best AUC, and metrics are calculated on the test set. The project also aims to reveal the factor by which predictor variables influence the odds ratio when increased by one unit. Finally, the profitability of applying the model is assessed based on gaining 100e for every true positive and losing 20e for every false positive.
